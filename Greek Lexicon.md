In Gal 1:7 ἄλλο is the second member of a play on words involving ἕτερος (vs. 6), the point being that the Galatians are inveigled into allegiance to ‘a good news’ that is different from the one Paul proclaimed; but the difference is of such a nature that the opposition ‘good news’ cannot even qualify as ‘good news’ (s. ἕτερος).

ἀλυσιτελής, ές [ἀ priv., λυσιτελέω] (the simplex verb λυσιτελέω bears the com mercial sense pay what is due and is also used in the extended sense to suffer something, as in pay with one’s life) ‘not in one’s best interest’, unprofitable, disad vantageous Hb 13:17.

ἄν [orig. not determined] a multivalent marker that nuances verbs with an aspect of contingency or generalization and affects the meaning of the immediate con text in which it occurs. Hence the translator will frequently qualify the pertinent verb form with such glosses as would, ever, might, depending on aspectual fea tures of the original.—a. in the indicative: impf. and aor., in pronominal or ad verbial generalizations, such as ὅπου wherever Mk 6:56a; ὅσοι whoever 6:56b; τις anyone Ac 2:45; 4:35. Impf., aor., and plpf., in the apodosis of a statement in which the speaker first (in the protasis, impf. or aor.) submits a conditional assumption that casts doubt on what is assumed and then (in apodosis) draws a conclusion that would properly follow (nuanced by ἄν and expressed in Engl. by would) if the data in the protasis were true: εἰ πιστεύετε Μωϋσεῖ, ἐπιστεύετε ἂν ἐμοί if you beliεved Moses, you would believe me J 5:46; εἰ ἐγένοντο αἱ δυνάμεις . . . πάλαι ἂν μετενόησαν if the miracles had been performed . . . they would long ago have repented Mt 11:21. The plpf. is used in place of the aor. in the apodosis of 1 J 2:19. Occasionally ἄν is used in the apodosis when the protasis is understood Mt 25:27 (ἐλθών serves as protasis); so also ἐπεί Hb 10:2.—b. in the subjunctive—α. in a relative clause that serves as a protasis with ἄν functioning as a generaliz ing marker, followed by an apodosis with fut. verb 1 Cor 11:27.—β. in a relative clause that is followed by an apodosis with verb in the present tense J 5:19; Ac 2:39.—γ. in temporal clauses, when an event which can and will occur is noted, but whose actual occurrence cannot yet be determined with certainty ἡνίκα ἄν every time that 2 Cor 3:15; ὡς ἄν as soon as Ro 15:24; ἕως ἄν until Lk 9:27; ἀφ’ οὗ ἄν after 13:25.—δ. in purpose clauses the Attic ὅπως ἄν 2:35; Ac 3:20.—c. with the opt. (which is seldom used in the NT) in a main clause Ac 26:29; in a rhetori cal question 8:31; 17:18; in an indirect question Lk 1:62.—d. ἄν for ἐάν, rare in later Gk. = if J 5:19a v.l.; 13:20; 16:23; 20:23.
ἀνά [IE] prep. w. acc. expressing the idea of distribution or movement relating to a set of entities—1. ἀνὰ μέσον, indicating mediate position: w. gen. among (of sowing in an area covered by grain) Mt 13:25; in the midst Mk 7:31 (of move ment within an area); between 1 Cor 6:5 (ἀνὰ μέσον ἀδελφοῦ: two ‘brothers’ are envisaged, but the singular is used in a colloquial expression; some copyists could not resist the temptation to add the omitted other ‘brother’).—2. ἀνὰ μέρος in turn 1 Cor 14:27.—3. distributive use with numerals: ἀνὰ δηνάριον a denarius each Mt 20:9, 10; ἀνὰ πεντήκοντα by fifties = ‘at the rate of fifty in each group’ Lk 9:14; ἀνὰ δύο by twos = ‘two together’ 10:1; adverbially in colloquial usage ἀνὰ εἷς ἕκαστος = ‘one by one, each (of the gates)’ Rv 21:21.—4. fr. the idea of move ment develops the use of ἀνά in some compounds (e.g. ἀναγγέλλω, ἀναγεννάω, ἀναγινωσκω) in the sense of repetition = again.

The wordplay in 22:13, with its twofold use of ἀναβλέπω is especially intriguing: the first occurrence can be understood simply as look up, but the context clearly overlays this with the idea of vision recovery, see again (as in 9:12, 17f ); the second occurrence indicates the direction of the glance he looked up at him.
ἀνάβλεψις, εως, ἡ [ἀνά, βλέψις ‘act of sight’ also ‘thing seen’, as compound fr. ἀναβλέπω] receipt of sight or simply sight Lk 4:18, without indication whether the recipients had become blind after experience of normal vision.

In wordplay w. γινώσκω: ἆρά γε γινώσκεις ἃ ἀναγινώσκεις; do you really ‘read’ what you’re reading?

μέν [affirming particle, cp. μήν and Skt. sma, intensive particle] emphatic marker—a. very often used in a statement that invites a contrasting, alternate, or modifying observation w. δέ or other markers, thus uniting statements often in opposition to one another: μὲν . . . δέ, this construction, in which μέν often focuses attention on its accompanying subject as foil for the observation made in the second member, may be variously rendered, e.g. on the one hand/indeed/now . . . but: μὲν . . . δέ Mt 3:11; 9:37; 17:11; 20:23; 22:8; 25:33; 26:41; Mk 14:21; Lk 11:48 (μέν = now it’s true that); 23:41, 56; J 10:41; 19:32; 20:30; Ac 1:5; 9:7; 11:19 (δέ appears in vs. 20; cp. Ac 17:12 and vs. 13, shaping an attitudinal contrast); Ro 2:25; 7:25; 1 Cor 1:12 (ἐγὼ μέν = as for me); 15:39f; 2 Cor 12:1; Gal 4:8; Eph 4:11; Phil 3:1, 13; 2 Ti 2:20; Hb 1:7 (δέ in vs. 8); 7:20 (δέ in vs. 21); 1 Pt 1:20; 4:6; Jd 10. In Lk 13:9 the succeeding δέ construction marks a switch from an anticipated inference; in 1 Cor 11:7 the succeeding δέ construction replaces a suppressed inference about a woman’s treatment of her hair. In Ac 8:4 μέν anticipates a narrative shift to one of the evangelists cited in vs. 5. In correlation w. a marker other than δέ in a suc ceeding clause, contrast is made even more emphatically: μέν . . . ἀλλά Mk 9:12f; Ro 14:20; 1 Cor 14:17; μέν . . . πλήν Lk 22:22; μέν . . . ἐπεῖτα J 11:6f; Js 3:17. In numerous constructions of μέν . . . δέ the definite article, relative pronoun, or in definite pronoun relate to serial items without focus on contrast: ὃ/ὃς μὲν . . . ὃ/ὃς δέ one . . . another Mt 13:8, 23; 21:35; Lk 23:33; Ro 14:5; 1 Cor 7:7 (ὁ μὲν οὕτως. . . ὁ δὲ οὕτως one this way, another that); Gal 4:23; pl. οἱ μὲν . . . οἱ δέ some . . . others Ac 14:4; 17:32; 27:44; Ro 2:7f; Eph 4:11; Phil 1:15f; 3:13; Jd 22f. In re lated manner τοῦτο μὲν . . . τοῦτο δέ at times . . . at other times Hb 10:33.—b. μέν without δέ or related marker expresses contrast now: in Ac 1:1 μέν lacks (un less one grants a text-transmission problem) a corresponding δέ, but the writ er’s public could probably infer from πρῶτος that a second account is forthwith in progress; in Ro 1:8 μέν suggests that Paul has many items to present, but the immediate focus is on thanksgiving; in 7:12 the implied contrast is the enabling power of sin discussed in vs. 11; in 1 Cor 6:7 δέ is replaced by a direct interrogative διὰ τί; in 2 Cor 12:12 the implied adversative is the resistance of some mem bers of the congregation, cp. 1 Cor 11:18; in Col 2:23 a rhetorically strong οὐκ does duty for δέ. For μὲν οὖν marking a stage in narrative with implied contrast, so then, rather Ac 9:31; cp. μενοῦν/μενοῦνγε.
Μεννά, ὁ [etym. not known] indecl.
